// that we have compiled.
//

// will "boot" the module and make it ready to use. Currently browsers
// don't support natively imported WebAssembly as an ES module, but
// eventually the manual initialization won't be required!

  // First up we need to actually load the wasm file, so we use the
  // default export to inform it where the wasm file is located on the
  // server, and then we wait on the returned promise to wait for the
  // wasm to be loaded.
  //
  // It may look like this: `await init('./pkg/without_a_bundler_bg.wasm');`,
  // but there is also a handy default inside `init` function, which uses
  // `import.meta` to locate the wasm file relatively to js file.
  //
  // Note that instead of a string you can also pass in any of the
  // following things:
  //
  // * `WebAssembly.Module`
  //
  // * `ArrayBuffer`
  //
  // * `Response`
  //
  // * `Promise` which returns any of the above, e.g. `fetch("./path/to/wasm")`
  //
  // This gives you complete control over how the module is loaded
  // and compiled.
  //
  // Also note that the promise, when resolved, yields the wasm module's
  // exports which is the same as importing the `*_bg` module in other
  // modes
  await init()

  // And afterwards we can use all the functionality defined in wasm.
